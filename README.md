Cassette is music manager supporting major torrents site to download, sync and stream tracks on-the-go :headphones:
### Features

 - [x] scan a music folder for tracks and artists
 - [ ] complete REST API (only endpoints used by frontend are implemented right now)
 - [x] search on Gazelle based trackers, like PTH.
 - [x] download torrents using rTorrent
 - [x] stream music in the browser
 
### How to use

There is no way to use it as-is for the moment as it is an alpha release, and unless you have some knowledge in nodejs, you shouldn't be using this. Comeback later for the beta release!

### How to build and develop

```
$ git clone git@github.com:vinz243/cassette.git
$ npm install yarn -g
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
I prefer using yarn over npm, it's like 10x faster.
